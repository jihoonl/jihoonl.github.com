<h2> PR2 Commander </h2>
<h3> Abstract </h3>
  <p>The goal of the hackathon is to implement a natural language command interface for the PR2 robot. We want the robot to receive natural language commands (such as “pick up the red block”) and perform the appropriate action. Towards this goal, we will integrate MIT’s Spatial Language Understanding (SLU) system (and its use of Mechanical Turk) with Brown’s Castle Builder using rosbridge, as well as adding various additional features.</p>
